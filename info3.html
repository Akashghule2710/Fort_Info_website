   <p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Murud-Janjira Fort is situated on an oval-shaped rock off the Arabian Sea coast near the port town of Murud, 165 km (103 mi) south of Mumbai. <b>Janjira is considered one of the strongest marine forts in India.</b> The fort is approached by sailboats from Rajapuri jetty. <br> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Janjira from the outside,
The main gate of the fort faces Rajapuri on the shore and can be seen only when one is about <b>40 feet (12 m) </b>away from it. It has a small postern gate towards the open sea for escape. <br> <br>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entry Gate into Murud Janjira Fort. Accessible by ferry.
The fort has 26 rounded bastions, still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make rusting on the bastions. Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the necessary facilities, e.g., palaces, quarters for officers, mosque, two small 60-foot-deep (18 m) natural fresh water lakes, etc. On the outer wall flanking the main gate, there is a sculpture depicting a tiger-like beast clasping elephants in its claws. <br> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special attraction of this fort are 3 gigantic cannons named <b>Kalalbangdi, Chavri and Landa Kasam. </b>These cannons were said to be feared for their shooting range. Another gate to the west is sea-facing, called <b>'Darya Darwaza'.</b> <br> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also another fortress, named <b>Ghosalgad,</b> which is located on top of the hill around <b>32 km (20 mi) east of Murud-Janjira,</b> that was used as outpost for the rulers of Janjira.</p> <br> <hr>
   <h2 class="design-hh">history if murud janjira :</h2>
   <p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During its heyday the island fort boasted having 572 cannons.
Visitors can gain access to the Janjira fort from Rajapuri, a small village on the coast. After a short ride in a small boat, one can enter the fort through the main entrance. The fort is oval shaped instead of the usual <b> oblong or square shape. </b>The fort wall is about <b> 40 feet high and has 19 rounded porches or arches,</b> some of which still have cannons mounted on them, including the famous cannon Kalaal Baangadi. <br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These cannons were largely responsible for repelling oncoming enemies from the sea. Inside the fort walls are the ruins of a mosque, a palace and bath with water channeled from streams, evidence that royal ladies occupied the quarters. A deep well, still functional, provides fresh water despite the fort being surrounded by salt water.<br><br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On shore is a luxurious cliff-top mansion, the Palace of the Nawab. Built by the former Nawab of Janjira, it commands a panoramic view of the <b>Arabian sea and the Janjira sea fort.</b>
According to another record, the Abyssinian Sidis established the Janjira and Jafarabad state in early 1100.<br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archaeological Survey of India noticeboard at fort entrance
According to accounts written by the Portuguese Admiral Fernão Mendes Pinto, the Ottoman fleet that first arrived in Aceh prior to the Ottoman expedition to Aceh led by Kurtoğlu Hızır Reis included 200 Malabar sailors from Janjira to aid the region of Batak and Maritime Southeast Asia in 1539. Later, in 1621, the Siddis of Janjira became exceptionally powerful as autonomous state to the point that the commander of Janjira, Siddi Ambar the Little, successfully defied his overlord Malik Ambar's attempt to replace him. <b> Siddi Ambar</b> the Little is accordingly considered the <b>first Nawab of Janjira state.</b><br></p> <hr>
