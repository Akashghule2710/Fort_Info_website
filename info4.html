   <p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torna Fort, also known as <b>Prachandagad</b>, is a large fort located in Pune district, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is historically significant because it was the first fort captured by king Shivaji Maharaj in 1646, at the age of 16, forming the nucleus of the Maratha empire. The hill has an elevation of <b>1,403 metres (4,603 ft)</b> above sea level, making it the highest hill-fort in the district. <br><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Shivaji Maharaj took over this fort from <b> Aadilshah (Sultan of Vijapur)</b> this fort did not had too much construction on it. This fort was not given more stratagic importance by the Aadilshahas. After capturing this fort, Shivaji Maharaj started to construct some buildings on the forts and fortification for the fort. This was necessary to make the fort a secure place which can be used in forthcoming war against the Aadilshah and the Mughals. While construction Shivaji Maharaj  found a treasure on the fort. Assuming this to be a good omen, he utilised this money on construction of this fort and  the fort "Rajgad".<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fort has two temples on it. <b>The first one is of goddess "Toranjai" and the second one is of goddess "Menghai". </b>You can stay in the temple of goddess "Menghai" if necessary. The fort has two major wings (in Marathi "Machi") the <b> "Zunzar Machi" and the "Budhala Machi"</b>. On the Budhala Machi, there is big vertical rock. When seen from distance it seems to be a thumb held up. The fort also has two gates: the <b>"Binicha Darwaja" (Bini Gate) and "Konkan Darwaja" (Konkan Gate)</b>. The Binich Darwaja takes you inside the fort, while the Konkan Darwaja takes you to the Budhala Machi.<br></p><hr>
   <h2 class="design-hh">history :</h2>
   <p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fort is believed to have been constructed by the Shaiva Panth, followers of the Hindu god Shiva, in the 13th century. A Menghai Devi temple, also referred to as the Tornaji temple, is situated near the entrance of the fort.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1646, King Shivaji captured this fort at the age of sixteen, thus making it one of the first forts that would become one of the forts of the Maratha empire. King Shivaji renamed the fort ' 'Prachandagad' ' as Torna, and constructed several monuments and towers within it.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 18th century, the Mughal empire briefly gained control of this fort after assassination of <b>King Shivaji's son king Sambhaji</b>. <b>Aurangzeb, the then Mughal emperor</b>, renamed this fort Futulgaib in recognition of the difficult defense the Mughals had to overcome to capture this fort. It was restored to the Maratha confederacy by the Treaty of Purandar.<br></p><hr>
