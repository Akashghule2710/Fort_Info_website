      <p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratapgad (also transcribed Pratapgarh) literally <b>'Valour Fort' </b>is a large fort located in <b>Satara district</b>, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra. Significant as the site of the Battle of Pratapgad, the fort is now a popular tourist <br><br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pratapgad fort is located <b>15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Poladpur and 23 kilometres (14 mi) west of Mahabaleshwar</b>, a popular hill station in the area. The fort stands <b>1,080 metres (3,540 ft) above sea level</b> and is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of <b>Par and Kinesvar</b><br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best thing about me is that I am built on a place which looks like the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar. My historical journey starts with Shri Shivaray near Mahabaleshwar. After sometime Shivaray noticed Pratapgad and took immediate decision to construct me as a fort. If he would have not taken the decision I was not made a fort today.<br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Pratapgad have two forts. One is an <b>upper fort</b> built on the top of the hill and the second one is a <b>lower fort</b> below the south and the east. Many tourists visit Pratapgad Fort every year because of my view points and landscapes. That is why I am a preferred tourist destination for tourists<br></p><hr>
      <h2 class="design-hh">history :</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj commissioned <b>Moropant Trimbak Pingle</b>, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was completed in 1656. The Battle of Pratapgad between <b>Shivaji and Afzal Khan</b> was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire. Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics. Sakharam Bapu, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad. <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1818, as part of the <b>Third Anglo-Maratha War</b>, Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation. This was a great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold, had a large garrison, and could suppress much of the country around <b> Wai.</b> <br></p><hr>
      <h2 class="design-hh">structure :</h2>
     
<p class="paragraph-design">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1661, Shivaji Maharaj was unable to visit the temple of the <b>goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur.</b> He decided to dedicate a temple to the goddess at this fort itself. This temple is on the eastern side of the lower fort. The hall has been rebuilt since the original construction, and consists of wooden pillars about 50' long, 30' broad and 12' high. The shrine is made of stone, and contains a clothed black stone image of the goddess. The roof of the temple is flat inside, but covered in lead covering put up by the <b>Satara Raja Pratapsinha (1818–1839).</b><br><br>
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small spire or shikhar covers the shrine.The temple also has the sword of Maratha General  <b>Hambirao Mohite</b> adorned with 6 diamond stones signifying that he had killed 600 soldiers in the battle. There is also a spatikha linga being worshipped inside the temple.The armors used in the battle during that period by the infantry soldiers are also on display just outside the temple<br>
