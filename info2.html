It is a reminder of the valour and audacity of the Marathas. <i>The Raigad fort is not just a tourist spot, it is a sacred place of pilgrimage which holds the imprints of the grand vision of Hindavi Swarajya as cherished by Chhatrapati Shivaji.</i> <br> <br>

The Britishers named it as the Gibraltar of the East as this well-fortified structure atop a hill had defied various attackers. It has several beguiling gates Nagarkhana Darwaja, Mena Darwaja, Maha Darwaja and Palkhi Darwaja. <b>There was also a statue of Shivaji erected in front of the ruins of the main market avenue that eventually leads to his own Samadhi and that of his beloved dog. </b><br> <br>
