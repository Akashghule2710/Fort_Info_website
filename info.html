     <p class="paragraph-design"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sinhagarh Fort (Singhagad Fort) lies about 30 km southwest of the city Pune in Maharashtra state. It stands on a high point of the Sahyadris about 1315 meters above sea level. Rising more than 750 meters above the surrounding plain, the fort is strategically located along a line of other forts such as Rajgad, Purandar and Torna. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously known as Kondhana after the sage Kaundinya, the fort has been a witness to many historic battles between Mughals and Marathas. It's history goes back to 1340 when the Delhi Emperor Muhammad Tughluq captured the fort from the Koli tribal chieftain, Nag Naik. And in 1496, Malik Ahmad, the founder of the Nizam Shahi dynasty took it. <br> <br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly 200 years later, the Maratha leader <b>Shahaji Bhonsale,</b> Shivaji's father (a general in the army of the Adil Shah) captured it. In 1647, Shivaji held the stronghold, renaming it Sinhagad, Lion Fort. Again, the fort subsequently changed hands on several occasions between the Marathas and the Mughals. In 1670, it was again captured by Shivaji, under the direction of Tanaji who was Shivaji's favourite general. <br> <br> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legends has it that he and his men used ropes to raise troops and animals up the sheer sides of the hill at night. Aurangazeb laid siege to Sinhagad in 1701- 03, but could not hold it for long. Finally the British seized the fort from the Marathas in 1818 AD. The fort was later used as retreat for many European residents of Pune. <br><br>  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinhagarh is a popular day out for people from Pune, with some enthusiasts trekking to the top of the fort from the base near Sinhagad village. It is about one and half hour trek. From here one can enjoy the majestic view of the mountain valley. The tower of Doordarshan is also there on Sinhagad. The fort also serves as <b>a training centre at National Defence Academy</b>, Khadakwasla. One can see the Panshet, Khadakwasla and Varasgaon dams and Torana fort also. <br>

  <h2 style="color: blue"><b>HISTORY OF SINHAGAD FORT :</b></h2>
  <p class="paragraph-design">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sinhgad Fort was initially known as <b>"Kondhana" </b>after the sage Kaundinya. The Kaundinyeshwar temple coupled with the caves and carvings indicate that the fort had probably been built around two thousand years ago. It was seized by Muhammad bin Tughlaq from the Koli king nag naik in 1328. <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shahaji Bhosale, as the commander of Ibrahim Adil Shah I, was entrusted with the control of the Pune region. His son Shivaji, refused to accept the Adilshahi and initiated the task of setting up Swarajya. Shivaji gained control of Kondana in 1647 by convincing Siddi Amber, the Adilshahi Sardar who controlled the fort, that he, the son of Shahaji Bhosale, could manage the fort's defences optimally. Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande played a key role in this activity. Adil Shah jailed Siddi Amber for this treasonous act and schemed to get it back. He imprisoned Shahaji Bhosale for a concocted crime and informed Shivaji. In 1649, Adil Shah traded the fort for Shahaji's release. Shivaji Maharaj recaptured it in 1656 again with the help of Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande who convinced the Fort commander by giving land in the newly created Shivapur village and peacefully gained control of the fort.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fort saw attacks by Mughals in 1662, 1663 and 1665. In 1664, <b>"Shahistekhan"</b>, a Mughal general, tried to bribe the people of the fort to hand it over to him, but was unsuccessful.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Treaty of Purandar, the fort passed into the hands of the Mughal army chief <b>"Mirzaraje Jaysingh" </b>in the year 1665.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1670, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj reconquered the fort for the third time and the fort came and stayed under the Maratha rule till 1689.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the death of Sambhaji, the Mughals regained control of the fort. The Marathas headed by "Sardar Balkawade", recaptured it in 1693. Chatrapati Rajaram took asylum in this fort during a Mogul raid on Satara but died in the Sinhagad Fort on 3 March, 1700.<br></p><br><hr>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most <b>famous battles on Sinhgad was fought by Tanaji Malusare,</b> a Koli[4] general of Chhatrapati Shivaji of the Maratha Empire in order to recapture the fort on March 1670.<br><br>
View from Sinhagad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A steep cliff leading to the fort was scaled in the dead of the night with the help of a tamed monitor lizard named "Yashwanti", colloquially known as a ghorpad. Thereafter, A fierce battle ensued between Tanaji and his men versus the Mughal army headed by "Udaybhan Singh Rathod", a Rajput sardar who had control of the fort. <b>Tanaji Malusare lost his life, but his brother "Suryaji" took over and captured the Kondana fort, now known as Sinhagad.</b><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an anecdote that upon hearing of Tanaji's death, Chhatrapati Shivaji expressed his remorse with the words, <b>"Gad aala, pan Sinha gela"</b> - "The Fort is conquered, but the Lion was lost".<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to some the name sinhagad predates this event.A bust of Tanaji Malusare was established on the fort in the memory of his contribution to the battle.</p><br><hr>
